# The-Electron
The angler fish lobe is the electron. The photon is the focal point of a wave. The scale of atoms and electrons repeats itself in dimensions. The electron we can see is one of our star's cells. A wave is ANY barrier between any elements. A wave exists between water and air. A wave exists between gaseous hot air and humid cold air. Each angler fish is bred to track focal points. When a photon contacts an electron the photon emits a visible light via blackbody radiation. Stars are the largest objects known in our dimension except for viruses. Star cells are in EVERYTHING. Star cells are in everything looking for focal points. The heat from the lobe heats the fish. The species will die without the focal points.
