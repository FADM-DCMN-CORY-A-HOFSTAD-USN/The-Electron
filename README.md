# The-Electron
The angler fish lobe is the electron. The photon is the focal point of a wave. The scale of atoms and electrons repeats itself in dimensions. The electron we can see is one of our star's cells. A wave is ANY barrier between any elements. A wave exists between water and air. A wave exists between gaseous hot air and humid cold air. Each angler fish is bred to track focal points.
